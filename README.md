COUNT DOWN SYSTEM 

Count Down System a real-time web application, a system that used to manage and monitor tasks that need to be done at a certain time. 
Once the task is completed, it can be marked with the relevant color.
I developed this system as part of my final project for a government organization.

To get the frontend running locally:  (port 3000)
1.Clone this repo
2.npm install to install all required dependencies
3.npm start 
To get the backend running: (different cmd)
 1.cd backend
 2.npm start
  
Finally:
Enter the username: Viewer.
Enter the password : sharonsProject.

***This version is still in development and incomplete

Have Fun!
