COUNT DOWN SYSTEM 

Count Down System a real-time web application, a system that used to manage and monitor tasks that need to be done at a certain time. 
Once the task is completed, it can be marked with the relevant color.
I developed this system as part of the final project for a government organization.

To get the frontend running locally:
  -Clone this repo
  -npm install to install all required dependencies
  -npm start 
To get the backend running:
  -cd backend
  -npm start

Have Fun!
